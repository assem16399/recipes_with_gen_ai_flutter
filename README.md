```

# Requirements:
### Functional
  - Sending User Pormpt to GEMINI API to Generate a recipe.
  - Displaying the recipe.
 
# Decisions

- This app was not focused on using clean architecture or following the best coding practices but was more focused on getting the functionality done, using the capabilities of GEMINAI API and creating an MVP  

   
# What could be improved
- Following BLoC architecture guild lines.
- Following clean code best practices
- Introducing repo design pattern.
- Implementing favoriting recipes feature.
